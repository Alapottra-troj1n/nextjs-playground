## Practicing Next.js with Typescript

*Difference between a Interface and Type in typescript is that Interface is describes objects more naturally so Interfaces are recommended to use for Objects and complex data structures while Type is used for simplier data aliases and functions.
*Can add optional value with :? in the type and define a optional value on the function parameter parameter:type=0
